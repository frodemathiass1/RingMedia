# RingMedia
Ring Media was a school assignment with OsloMet - Storbyuniversitet for the course ADTS - Webprosjekt.
This is the 3nd assignment in the first year and schoo semester and is representing the beginning of the coding journey.
Ring Media is a Mediaplayer application that was conceptualized, and prototyped as included on the webpage.
It was a group effort, which was graded with an A, which is why the source coded is shared on github, as part of a portfolio.
